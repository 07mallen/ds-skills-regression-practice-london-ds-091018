# Midterm Practice: Predicting Boston Home Values

In this lab, we are predicting the natural log of the sum of all transactions per user.  
This is a great chance to practice all of our skills to date in order to create a regression model.
Start by importing the data and analyzing it briefly. Then, start fitting a model and performing successive iterations to tune and refine your model.

All data is stored in a csv file, 'train.csv' in the Data folder.
